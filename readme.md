## Dark Mode Toggle Script

This JavaScript snippet enables a simple Dark Mode / Light Mode toggle functionality for your website.  
It listens for user interaction and dynamically applies or removes a CSS class dark-modeto switch between themes.

The script waits until the DOM is fully loaded before running.  
It then detects clicks on a button theme-toggle and toggles a dark-mode class on the <body> element.

When dark mode is activated:

- The page background and text colors switch according to your dark-mode CSS rules.
- The button text updates to indicate the active mode (Light Mode or Dark Mode).

## Semantics

- added semantics for easy seo
